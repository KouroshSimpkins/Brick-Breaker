# Project for Foundation Methods for Creative Computing 0

This is the location where I will be uploading my project for my foundation year of Creative Computing at UAL, for the module "Foundational Methods for Creative Computing 1".

>**Coursework: students will be required to show a running program which achieve assigned objectives. The assignments will be given throughout the term. (50%)**

I have outlined the brief below

>**Brief:** Use P5.js to program a simple and interactive game that expands on some of the concepts that we have covered in the past term.

The final code that we produce should include the fill or background command to change the colour of something on the screen, as well as using at least one conditional statement.

## "So what's your project?"

The game I will be reproducing in P5 will be a game called brick break. Essentially I'm building a clone of the classic Atari game 'Breakout' released on May 13, 1976 (later released with the Atari 2600). The game involves hitting a ball that is in motion on the screen to break a series of blocks that are lined up at the top of the screen. Breaking all of the blocks completes a level.

I have outlined an (extremely) basic plan below for how I'm going to go about completing this project. As such, I have also shown that I have finished off the initial plan, as I have presented this on the 16<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, and received feedback on my idea.
